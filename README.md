# VBA-Excel-Macs
Exported Microsoft Excel VBA Macros and Userforms that have proven useful.

Note: All Macros and Userforms were created using Microsoft Excel 2010.

# Macros
1. **Miniature_Macs.bas**

    Macro library for short, but sweet, macros.

2. **Functions.bas**

    Module file of supporting functions for the macros in the Miniature_Macs.bas file.
    
    Note: some functions in this module will only work if VBA Extensibility is added to the References via Visual Basic Editor -> Tools -> References...


# Userforms
1. **Form_CreateNamedRange**

    Used to easily create Named Ranges for developing multi-sheet and multi-workbook Excel applications. So far only static ranges can be built.
